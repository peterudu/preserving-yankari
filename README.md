Preserving Yankari is a site which seeks to maintain the existence of the Yankari National Park by raising awareness about the park to the world. It highlights the attractions of the park and the threats that it faces. The site intends to target Nigerian citizens as well as foreigners such as tourists and conservationists world wide.

### Features To Be Implemented
 - A Future Idea
    - Create a section where comments and suggestions made by users are displayed as part of a page.
    - A comments section would encourage users to participate in the further development of the site
## Testing
- The pages were tested on Chrome, Firefox and Edge browsers and they all worked well
- I confirm that the form input fields were all tested and their validation check works.
- I tested the website on Lighthouse for accessibility on moblie and desktop devices. For both devices the accessibility was over 90 percent.
