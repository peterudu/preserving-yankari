                    <p>The Yankari National Park was originally created as a game reserve in 1956, before being upgraded to a national park in 1991.</p>
                    <p>From 1991 it was managed by the National Parks Service until 2006 when responsibility for the management of the reserve was handed back to Bauchi State Government.</p>
                    <p>Significantly, in 2014 the World Conservation Soceity (WCS) signed an agreement(MoU) with the Bauchi State Government for the co-management of Yankari National Park. This agreement gave WCS full responsibility for the ranger program.</p>
